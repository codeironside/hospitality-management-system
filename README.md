# GuestQuest: The Ultimate Trial 🚀

Welcome to **GuestQuest**, my first (and *hopefully* successful) attempt at creating an all-in-one hospitality management software! 🎉 Whether you're running a restaurant, club, suite, or hotel, this app *aims* to make things easier for you... or at least, that’s the plan. 😅

## Features (If I Get This Right)
- 🏨 **Booking Management**: Keep track of room and table reservations like a pro.
- 🛒 **Inventory Control**: Know when you’ve run out of those fancy drinks.
- 💼 **Employee Scheduling**: Because somebody needs to be at the front desk.
- 💵 **Billing & Payments**: Make sure you get paid. We all need that!
- 📊 **Customer Insights**: Know your regulars... if they come back.

## Tech Stack 💻
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: PyQt/QT (Maybe… if I don’t change my mind halfway through)
- **Database**: MongoDB (I promise I’ll back it up)
- **Hosting**: TBD (Let's hope I make it that far)

## Installation ⚙️
For those brave enough to give it a try:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/codeironside/hospitality-management-system.git](https://github.com/codeironside/hospitality-management-system.git)
cd hospitality-management-system
npm install
npm start
```

## Contributing 🤝
Feel free to point out my bugs, suggest improvements, or just send me words of encouragement. 🙏

## Disclaimer ⚠️
This is my first trial, so things *will* break, probably when you least expect it. But hey, we live, we learn, we code!
